The project aims to realize the geyserâ€™s natural phenomenon caused by a water explosion through **WebGL** and **Three.js**
technologies.

The idea is to simulate the physics of water and steam particles:
* description of the motion of water particles following a parabolic trajectory;
* description of the randomic motion of steam particles in 3D space;
* creation of a pseudo-realistic scene.

The physics of the particles system is done thorough **shaders programming** with WebGL.

The project is developed by [Alessandro Sestini](https://github.com/SestoAle) and [Francesco Lombardi](https://github.com/fralomba)

An interactable example is reachable [here](https://sestoale.github.io/GeyserCG-3D/).

Some controls have been implemented in order to let the users be able to customize their experience; an example is shown here:
